## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 



## Conclusions
Boom Bikes keep close eye on weather forecast as

with increase with temp demand increase.
windspeed, snow/rain and cloudy decrease demand.
Seasonwise, Summer and winter will see high demands.

Monthwise september seems to be high demand month while Jan and July seems to be low. So they can work on the staffing or other menthods to meet demand and supply.
